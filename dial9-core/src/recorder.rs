//! The recorder builder.

//! [`recorder`] assembles a [`Recorder`](crate::recording::Recorder): it
//! builds the shared bus, registers your [`Source`](crate::source::Source)s,
//! spawns the flush thread (and, with the `pipeline` feature, the background
//! worker), and starts recording.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use dial9_core::buffer::DiskBuffer;
//! let recorder = dial9_core::recorder::recorder(DiskBuffer::single_file("/tmp/trace.bin")?)
//!     .build();
//! // record events through `recorder.handle()`.
//! # Ok::<(), std::io::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! This wraps low-level `Recorder::start`, which expects a pre-built
//! [`SharedState`](crate::shared_state::SharedState) with sources already
//! registered. The Tokio integration reuses the same builder.
