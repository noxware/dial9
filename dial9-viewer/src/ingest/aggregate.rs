//! Sampling based, demand-driven aggregation
//!
//! Instead of batch-aggregating an entire window up front, a query folds
//! [source files] one at a time, in a deterministic pseudo-random [order key]
//! order that is uniform across host and time, so the first few files are a
//! representative spread of the scope. Results are served over whatever subset
//! has been folded so far, with a [coverage] report, and refined as more files
//! fold.
//!
//! Key properties (see `docs/adr/0003-folded-set-is-the-output-listing.md`):
//!
//! - **The output part-file's existence is the record that a file is folded.**
//!   There is no manifest and no skip-set. A zero-sample file still writes an
//!   empty part-file, so it is never re-fetched.
//! - **Folding is idempotent.** A source file folds to a deterministically
//!   named part-file (`samples/service=…/date=…/host=…/{blake3(source_key)}`),
//!   so re-folding writes the same key.
//! - **Aggregation reads part-files through the `StorageBackend`**, so it works
//!   identically over S3, the local FS, and the simulated S3 used in tests.
//!
//! [source files]: crate::ingest::aggregate
//! [order key]: order_key
