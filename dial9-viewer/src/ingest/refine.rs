//! The demand-driven **refinement loop** — the orchestration layer over the
//! [`aggregate`] kit of parts.
//!
//! A query [resolves](resolve) its full ordered source scope plus a capped prefix
//! for new work. Generic aggregate streams first reuse every folded matching
//! part, then [stream folds](fold_stream) for missing files inside that prefix
//! (idempotently), one file at a time, so callers can emit incremental updates.
//! Flamegraph and span-stats share this driver; Tokio stats retains a custom
//! capped-prefix reader for its endpoint-specific accumulator.
//!
//! The control flow is **stream-driven**: a single held-open request resolves
//! the scope once, streams all matching cached parts in bounded cumulative
//! snapshots, then folds missing capped-prefix files concurrently and pushes a
//! fresh snapshot as each file completes. Folding stops when the work-list
//! drains or the client disconnects (the fold [`JoinSet`] is dropped, cancelling
//! in-flight folds), and re-folding is safe by idempotency. See `CONTEXT.md` ("Refinement
//! loop") for the vocabulary.
