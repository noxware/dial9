//! Per-request AWS credential resolution for S3 reads. A request can supply its
//! identity one of two ways, never both:
//!
//!   1. **Bring-your-own-credentials (BYOC)** — temporary credentials in the
//!      `x-dial9-aws-{access-key-id,secret-access-key,session-token}` headers.
//!      The backend signs S3 with exactly those; it never holds standing access.
//!   2. **Assume-role** — a role ARN in the `x-dial9-aws-role-arn` header. The
//!      backend assumes that role with its OWN ambient identity (STS) and signs
//!      S3 with the minted temporary credentials. This is the secondary path
//!      for a deployment that *has* credentials (an instance/task role allowed
//!      to assume the target's reader role) rather than receiving them.
//!
//! Both transports are per-request (no server-side session store). The
//! [`MaybeCreds`] extractor parses the headers into a [`CredSource`];
//! [`crate::server::AppState::resolve`] turns that into an ephemeral
//! [`crate::storage::S3Backend`] — minting credentials via STS first for the
//! assume-role variant.
