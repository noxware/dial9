// Time-panel layout invariant: every time-based panel splits its width as
// label gutter (LABEL_W) + draw area (drawW) + scrollbar (scrollbarW),
// with drawW = pw - LABEL_W - scrollbarW, so all panels map the same
// timestamp to the same x and their time axes line up vertically. A panel
// that redefines the gutter silently shifts its axis relative to every
// other panel.
//
// This module is the single producer of layout geometry in src/: every
// canvas component receives a PanelGeometry built here, and nothing else
// imports panel_layout.js directly. The wrapper is pure - callers pass
// measured widths in - so DOM reads batch once per frame instead of
// interleaving with draws.
