// App-level trace vocabulary.
//
// This is the single import surface for trace-domain types in `src/`: it
// re-exports the frozen core's shapes (declared in the ambient wildcard
// modules of src/types/*.d.ts) and adds the app-level shapes the core does
// not return -- most importantly the kind-discriminated RuntimeEvent union
// that makes event switches compiler-exhaustive.
//
// FORM: unlike the ambient `declare module "*/x.js"` blocks describing real
// .js files, this is an importable module .d.ts. There is NO backing .js
// module at runtime, so this file must contain TYPES ONLY -- no
// `export const`, no functions. Consumers must use
// `import type { ... } from "../types/trace.js"`; `verbatimModuleSyntax`
// (tsconfig) turns any accidental value import into a compile error (TS1484),
// so a runtime import of the nonexistent module cannot ship.
//
// Block-in-place gap is unknowable: gap-related absence is encoded
// EXPLICITLY, never silently optional. `tid` on park/unpark variants is a
// required `number | undefined` -- constructors must acknowledge old traces
// that predate the field rather than forget them.

// ── Re-exported core shapes ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The parsed-trace shape: workers, polls, spans, custom events, CPU/heap
// samples, sched events, queue series, block-in-place gaps. Type-only
// re-exports; erased at build time.

// open poll at the segment's end ("segment rotated mid-poll, not a long
// poll") and IGNORES the dangling PollEnd at the next segment's start. Under
// segment-windowed loading these shapes carry that boundary evidence through
// the parsed output instead:
//
// - When BOTH neighbors are resident, the two halves stitch back into a
//   complete poll (StitchedBoundaryPoll).
// - When the neighbor is beyond the resident window (evicted/unfetched),
//   the poll surfaces explicitly truncated at the window edge
//   (WindowEdgePoll) - the open-ended marker extended to window edges, never
//   a long-poll false positive and never silently dropped data.
//
// Additive only: nothing in the core's PollSpan changes.
