# dial9-viewer UI

Static HTML/JS frontend for the trace viewer, embedded into the `dial9-viewer`
binary via `rust-embed` and served by the server (`../src/server/`). In dev,
the assets are served from disk by `../src/bin/dev_server.rs`.

## UI development requires Node

The served assets are the BUILT output in `dist/` (gitignored), not the
sources in this directory. Working on the UI requires Node (CI uses Node 24):

```bash
npm ci            # lockfile-pinned install (never `npm install` in CI)
npm run build     # vite build -> dist/ (what rust-embed embeds)
npm run test      # vitest
npx tsc --noEmit  # typecheck
```

A cargo-only checkout still compiles (`dist/.gitkeep` keeps the folder
present) but serves an empty UI until `npm run build` runs. End users never
need Node: release CI builds `dist/` before publishing, so the crates.io
archive and the prebuilt binaries carry the built assets.

## Dev loops

Two ways to work on the UI (ADR-0004 section 3). Both use the Rust
dev-server as the API backend:

```bash
PORT=3001 cargo run -p dial9-viewer --bin dev-server --features dev-server
```

**Proxy mode (primary, HMR):**

```bash
npm run dev       # Vite dev server, prints its URL (default :5173)
```

Browse the Vite URL: `/api/*` is proxied to the dev-server on :3001
(`server.proxy` in `vite.config.ts`), edits to `src/` modules hot-reload
in the browser, and the root HTML entries and classic scripts are served
from this directory.

**Embedded mode (single-server, edit -> refresh):**

```bash
npm run dev:embedded   # vite build --watch -> dist/
```

Browse the dev-server directly (http://localhost:3001): it serves `dist/`
from disk, and the watch build rewrites `dist/` on every edit - including
edits to the two statically copied browser-global scripts and the `public/`
assets. Edit, refresh, done. `dial9 serve --dev` serves the same `dist/` from
disk (run it from the repo root or `dial9-viewer/`).

Root-served verbatim assets (`demo-trace.bin`, `flamegraph.css`) live in
`public/`: Vite serves `public/` at `/` in dev mode and copies it into the
`dist/` root at build, so the pages' root-relative references keep working
in both modes. The Vitest suites read the demo trace from
`public/demo-trace.bin`.

Key files:

- `*.html` — thin Vite multi-page entries at the canonical routes.
- `src/pages/` — page behavior for the browser, viewer, flamegraph, Tokio
  stats, and span explorer.
- `decode.js` — low-level binary trace-frame decoder (`TraceDecoder`).
- `trace_parser.js` — higher-level parser (`parseTrace`, `fetchTraces`, …)
  built on `decode.js`. Works in both the browser and Node.

## The `trace=` query parameter

`trace=` is **repeatable**. Each value is fetched independently and may be
individually gzipped. The decoder treats a concatenated stream as multiple
segments — a mid-stream `TRC\0` header resets the frame parser — so N components
parse as one trace. Read all values with `params.getAll('trace')`, never
`params.get`.

The viewer and flamegraph **stream** the components whenever the runtime
supports it (`DecompressionStream` + a readable `fetch` body):
`TraceParser.fetchTracesStream()` dispatches every component's `fetch()` up
front (so downloads run concurrently) and yields their gunzipped chunks
back-to-back, in order, into a single `parseTraceStream`. Parsing the first
segment then overlaps the in-flight downloads of the rest, so total load time is
~`max(download, parse)` instead of `download_all + parse` — the same win the
single-URL path already had, now for N components too (issue #595).

`TraceParser.fetchTraces()` is the non-streaming fallback (no
`DecompressionStream`, e.g. some Node test runtimes): it awaits every component
in parallel, runs each through `maybeGunzip`, concatenates the raw bytes, and
hands the whole buffer to `parseTrace`. Same bytes, but no fetch/parse overlap.

For S3-backed traces, `index.html` points each `trace=` at
`/api/object?bucket=&key=`, which serves one file's raw (still-gzipped) bytes.
The browser thus downloads the files in parallel and decompresses them
client-side — far less network transfer than a single merged response.

## The `s_*` scope parameters (large selections)

One `trace=` per file means a large heatmap selection produces a very long URL.
Opening the viewer/flamegraph is a navigation (a GET), so the whole list rides
in the URL — and past ~8 KB it exceeds CloudFront's hard request-URI limit, so
the new tab gets a **414** before it can load. For S3-backed selections the S3
browser instead emits a compact **scope** (`trace_scope.js`):

- `s_bucket`, `s_prefix`, `s_svc` — where to look
- `s_host` — repeatable host set (empty = all hosts in the window)
- `s_from`, `s_to` — time window, epoch seconds

The viewer/flamegraph re-list the matching files from the scope via `/api/browse`
(the same listing the S3 browser uses) and feed the resulting `/api/object` URLs
into `fetchTraces`. A scope is bounded by *host count*, not *file count*, so it
stays short; and because it is **stateless** (no per-browser storage), a shared
deep link re-resolves in any browser — this is what keeps the userscript's
"Copy deep link" feature working for large selections. A pathological host set
that still wouldn't fit degrades to time-range-only (all hosts in the window);
the UI warns when that happens. Consumers read a scope via
`Dial9TraceScope.readScope(params)` and fall back to inline `trace=` for non-S3
sources (locally-dropped files, `blob:` URLs, the demo trace).

Re-listing means a scope opened later may pick up files that landed in the
window since it was shared. For a finished trace that is nil; it is the trade
for a portable, length-safe link.

`trace_scope.js` owns the **Scope** concept end-to-end: `parseKey` /
`extractPrefix` (the single source of truth — `index.html` delegates to them),
`scopeFromKeys` (derive a scope from a selection), and two sibling encoders for
its two URL dialects. `encodeScope` writes the namespaced `s_*` form above (it
rides in the viewer page URL alongside unrelated `host`/`from`/`to`/`start`/`end`
params). `encodeAggregationParams` writes the **un-namespaced** form the server
aggregation endpoints expect — `bucket`/`prefix`/`service`/repeatable `host`,
window as `start_ns`/`end_ns` in **nanoseconds** — used by the demand-driven
flamegraph (`?api=1`) and `/api/tokio-stats`. A box spanning more than one
service sends *no* service filter (all services in the box), consistent across
exact and aggregation modes.

### `/api/trace` (deprecated)

`GET /api/trace?bucket=&keys=a&keys=b` fetches every key, gunzips each
server-side, and returns one concatenated **uncompressed** blob. This is
**deprecated and slated for removal**: it transfers far more bytes (the merged,
decompressed trace) and serializes the work on the backend. The UI no longer
links to it; it remains only for out-of-tree callers (e.g. the
`dial9-trace-loading` skill). New code should fetch individual objects via
`/api/object` and let `fetchTraces` merge them.

## URL contract (stable deep-link API)

The pages' URLs are an API, for humans sharing links and for agents driving
the UI without a browser (issue #303): a report generator, a skill, or a
`curl`-style script can construct a URL from the tables below and know the
page will honor it. This section is the normative contract; the skills that
emit viewer links (`../skills/dial9-html-report`, `../skills/dial9-zoom-window`)
and the contract tests (see Enforcement below) follow it.

**Stability promise (architecture NFR N10): old params stay valid forever.**
Evolution is additive-only: a param documented here never changes meaning,
never gets removed, and never stops being honored by the page that owns it.
New capability means a NEW query param or hash key, and adding one requires
updating this section, the ledger (`docs/tickets/ledger.md`), and the
contract tests in the same PR.

The split, made explicit:

- **QUERY string = load scope + page-owned state.** What data to load
  (`trace=`, time-range filters) and per-page state that predates the hash
  codec (browser-page search state, flamegraph zoom, api-mode facets).
  Query params can reach the server and are preserved verbatim by every
  view-state rewrite.
- **HASH = versioned view state** (`#v=1&...`), what the reader is LOOKING
  at, never what is loaded. Owned by the T19 codec; never reaches the server.
  Normative schema: `docs/ui-inventory/05-url-view-state.md` (codec:
  `src/lib/url/view-state.ts`).

### Query params - viewer.html and flamegraph.html (exact mode)

Both trace-rendering pages accept this compatible URL vocabulary (the browser
page emits it via `traceTitleParams`/`objectTraceUrls`):

| Param | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `trace` | URL, **repeatable** | Trace component to fetch and gunzip client-side; N values parse as one trace (see "The `trace=` query parameter" above). Relative or absolute; must be same-origin-fetchable. |
| `start` | absolute monotonic ns (integer) | Viewer: visible viewport start. Flamegraph: inclusive parse-time filter start. |
| `end` | absolute monotonic ns (integer) | Viewer: visible viewport end. Flamegraph: inclusive parse-time filter end. |
| `svc` | string | Service name, display label only. |
| `host` | string | Host name, display label only. |
| `segs` | integer as string | Segment COUNT for the header/stats display (index.html sets `String(keys.length)`); NOT a list of segment keys. |
| `from` | string | Human-readable wall-clock range start, display only. |
| `to` | string | Human-readable wall-clock range end, display only. |
| `worker-zoom` | TAB-joined frame names, root -> target | Flamegraph only: stable worker-tree zoom path (features/03 F148/F150), mirrored with `fg.w` when zoom changes. |
| `offworker-zoom` | same | Flamegraph only: off-worker-tree zoom path (F149). |
| `inspect` | frame display name | Flamegraph only: inspected/butterfly focus. |
| `inspect_full` | full frame symbol | Flamegraph only: inspection identity when it differs from `inspect`; omitted otherwise. |
| `prof` | `1` | Viewer only, debug: enables the render profiler (features/02 A14). Honored but not part of any UI's emitted links. |

`start`/`end` are ABSOLUTE monotonic nanoseconds, the same values carried by
`event.ts`/`trace.minTs` from `TraceParser.parseTrace()`, NOT offsets from
trace start. `viewer.html` uses them as viewport bounds and uses the additive
`data-start`/`data-end` pair for its parse filter. `flamegraph.html` retains
the original parse-filter meaning.

### Query params - viewer.html durable view state

The trace viewer owns these additive parameters. They are
canonicalized with `history.replaceState` after each settled store update;
defaults are omitted. Values are semantic anchors where possible, so agents
can construct them directly. `start`/`end` are the visible viewport here;
`data-start`/`data-end` are the distinct parse-time Set Range filter. For
`v1:` lists, percent-encode the complete query value once in the normal URL
way (`TAB` becomes `%09`, newline `%0A`); commas inside names need no special
list escaping. Previously emitted comma/pre-encoded list values remain readable.

| Param | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `start` | monotonic ns | Visible viewport start (does not discard data). |
| `end` | monotonic ns | Visible viewport end. Valid only with `start < end`. |
| `task` | integer or `0x` hex | Selected task. |
| `span-filter` | string | Span text filter. |
| `track-order` | comma-separated track ids | Analysis-track order. |
| `collapsed` | comma-separated track ids | Collapsed analysis tracks. |
| `field-chart` | **repeatable** `<id>,<event>,<field>,<kind>` | Numeric custom-event chart definitions; event and field names containing commas are unsupported. `kind` is `gauge`, `counter`, or `updown-counter`. Dynamic ids may also appear in `track-order`/`collapsed`. |
| `span` | span id | Lane-highlighted span (ancestor chain is re-derived). |
| `span-focus` | span id | Span-panel subtree root. |
| `poll` | `<startNs>:<taskId>` | Poll-detail anchor. |
| `task-dump` | `<taskId>:<timestamp>[,<timestamp>...]` | Selected task-dump captures. |
| `event` | monotonic ns | Pinned custom-event cluster timestamp. |
| `region` | `<startNs>-<endNs>` | Retained analysis region. |
| `spawned` | `<startNs>-<endNs>` | Queue-track spawned-task range. |
| `issue` | POI detector id | Issues filter. |
| `issue-sort` | `<worker\|kind\|time\|duration>,<asc\|desc>` | Issues ordering. |
| `issue-index` | non-negative integer | Current issues cursor. |
| `span-pct` | `50` \| `90` \| `95` \| `99` | Span percentile floor. |
| `span-names` | `v1:` + TAB-joined names | Enabled span legend chips. |
| `event-names` | same | Enabled custom-event legend chips. |
| `rail` | `issues` \| `tasks` | Visible rail tab. |
| `task-sort` | `<id\|loc\|polls\|total\|longest\|lifetime>,<asc\|desc>` | Tasks ordering. |
| `task-index` | non-negative integer | Current Tasks cursor. |
| `runtime-collapsed` | `v1:` + TAB-joined names | Folded runtime groups. |
| `runtime-metrics-collapsed` | `v1:` + TAB-joined names | Runtimes whose summary lane is folded to its one-line strip. |
| `inspector-width` | positive CSS pixels | Inspector width. |
| `lanes-height` | positive CSS pixels | Worker-lanes viewport height. |
| `lanes-scroll` | non-negative CSS pixels | Worker-lanes vertical position. |
| `stack-view` | `list` \| `flame` | Poll/blocking stack presentation. |
| `inspector` | `task` \| `poll` \| `event` \| `related` \| `stack` | Visible inspector tab. |
| `poll-section` | `cpu` \| `sched` | Poll flamegraph sample family. |
| `poll-expanded` | `v1:` + TAB-joined group ids | Expanded poll list groups. |
| `poll-worker-zoom` | TAB-joined frame path | Poll worker-tree flamegraph zoom. |
| `poll-offworker-zoom` | same | Poll off-worker-tree flamegraph zoom. |
| `related-collapsed` | `v1:` + TAB-joined titles | Collapsed Related sections. |
| `related-expand` | `v1:` + newline-joined `<title><TAB><before><TAB><after>` entries | Related load-more counts. |
| `related-key` | string | Correlation field key. |
| `related-value` | string | Correlation field value; active with `related-key`. |
| `analysis` | `cpu` \| `blocking` \| `heap` | Region-analysis mode. |
| `heap-weight` | `bytes` \| `count` | Heap flamegraph weighting. |
| `blocking-group` | `leaf` \| `full` | Blocking-list grouping. |
| `analysis-worker-zoom` | TAB-joined frame path | Region worker-tree flamegraph zoom. |
| `analysis-offworker-zoom` | same | Region off-worker-tree flamegraph zoom. |
| `analysis-inspect` | full frame key | Region flamegraph butterfly/inspect focus. |
| `span-index` | non-negative integer | Current filtered-span navigation cursor. |
| `data-start` | monotonic ns | Parse-time Set Range lower bound. |
| `data-end` | monotonic ns | Parse-time Set Range upper bound. |

Clock mode (`tm`) and timezone (`tz`) remain in the versioned hash. Unknown
query params are preserved. Invalid known values are ignored rather than
coerced. Hover, in-flight drag, temporary search/help modals, toasts, and load
progress are intentionally transient and are not deep-linked.

### Query params - flamegraph.html aggregated API mode (`?api=1`)

`api=1` switches the flamegraph page to server-aggregated mode; scope and
facet params are rebuilt and `history.pushState`ed on every Apply/facet
change (features/03 F168/F180), so Back walks the filter history:

| Param | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `api` | `1` | Mode switch. |
| `data_dir` | path | Local-directory scope (alternative to bucket/prefix). |
| `bucket` | string | S3 scope bucket. |
| `prefix` | string | S3 scope key prefix. |
| `service` | string | Scope service name. |
| `host` | string, **repeatable** | Scope host filter. |
| `start_ns` | epoch ns | Scope window start (seeds the UTC picker). |
| `end_ns` | epoch ns | Scope window end. |
| `source` | `cpu` (default) etc. | Facet filter: sample source. |
| `thread_class` | string | Facet filter. |
| `spawn_location` | string | Facet filter. |
| `max_files` | integer | Refinement fold ceiling. |
| `inspect` | frame display name | Inspected/butterfly focus; replaced in place and preserved across scope changes. |
| `inspect_full` | full frame symbol | Inspection identity when it differs from `inspect`; omitted otherwise. |

Canvas zoom remains deliberately NOT URL-synced in api mode (F180). Inspection
is restored as aggregate snapshots arrive.

### Query params - index.html (trace browser)

Owned by `url_state.js` (its header is the field-level contract); serialized
with the History API on state changes, defaults omitted. Service-tab changes
push history entries so Back/Forward restores the focused service:

| Param | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `bucket` | string | S3 bucket name. |
| `aws_region` | string | Region the bucket lives in (cross-region buckets). |
| `prefix` | string | User-entered key prefix. |
| `service` | string | Focused Browse service tab and exact backend filter. |
| `tab` | `raw` | Active tab; `browse` is the default and omitted. |
| `tz` | `local` | Timezone toggle; `utc` is the default and omitted. |
| `last` | positive number | Relative quick range in hours ("last N hours from now"). Mutually exclusive with `from`/`to`; wins when both present. |
| `from` | epoch seconds | Precise window start. NOTE: same NAME as the viewer's display-only `from`, different page, different meaning - both stable. |
| `to` | epoch seconds | Precise window end. |
| `q` | string | Raw-search prefix query. |

### Hash - versioned view state (`#v=1`)

The hash carries a form-encoded payload with a leading integer version:
`#v=1&fg.w=<tab-joined path>&tm=abs`. Full grammar, precedence against the
stable zoom query params, tolerant-reader and version rules:
`docs/ui-inventory/05-url-view-state.md`. The v1 key registry, with honest
status:

| Key | Status | Meaning |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `v` | live | Schema version, currently `1`. Required; a hash without a well-formed integer `v` is foreign and left alone. |
| `fg.w` | live (flamegraph) | Worker-tree zoom path; overrides `worker-zoom` per field, which fills gaps. |
| `fg.o` | live (flamegraph) | Off-worker-tree zoom path. |
| `fg.i` | live (flamegraph) | Inspect (butterfly) focus display name; overrides legacy `inspect`. |
| `fg.if` | live (flamegraph) | Inspect focus symbol; overrides legacy `inspect_full`. Emitted only when it differs from `fg.i`. |
| `fg.s` | live (flamegraph) | Frames-search query; overrides legacy `search`. |
| `fg.sp` | live (flamegraph) | Spawn-location filter value (exact mode); overrides legacy `spawn`. |
| `fg.rt` | live (flamegraph) | Runtime filter value (exact mode); overrides legacy `runtime`. |
| `tm` | live (viewer) | Clock display mode (`rel`\|`abs`). |
| `tz` | live (viewer) | Timezone (`utc`\|`local`) for absolute timestamps. |
| `vp` | reserved hash name | Not honored in hash; the viewer uses query `start`/`end`. |
| `sel.*` | reserved hash names | Not honored in hash; the viewer uses readable selection query params. |
| `poi` | reserved hash name | Not honored in hash; rail cursors are page-owned query params. |

Reserved hash keys claim the NAME only. Emitting them does nothing; the
viewer query implementation does not activate or reinterpret them.

### Deep-link recipes for agents (issue #303)

The three asks from #303, in contract terms:

1. **Open the viewer at an exact window, optionally with Set Range:**

   ```
   viewer.html?trace=<trace-url>&start=<visible-start-ns>&end=<visible-end-ns>
   viewer.html?trace=<trace-url>&data-start=<parse-start-ns>&data-end=<parse-end-ns>&start=<visible-start-ns>&end=<visible-end-ns>
   ```

   All values are absolute monotonic nanoseconds. Omit `data-start`/`data-end`
   to keep the full trace zoomable; include them to reproduce a Set Range
   reparse exactly.

2. **Open a flamegraph, optionally pre-zoomed to a subtree:**

   ```
   flamegraph.html?trace=<trace-url>&start=<ns>&end=<ns>&worker-zoom=<f1>%09<f2>
   ```

   Emit the stable `worker-zoom`/`offworker-zoom` QUERY form for maximum
   compatibility with existing links. The hash form
   `#v=1&fg.w=<f1>%09<f2>` is equivalent and wins per
   field when both are present. Zoom restore is gated on the time-range
   filter reproducing the shared tree (F151), so carry the same
   `start`/`end` the zoomed view had (or none).

3. **Select an analysis target and exact surface:**

   ```
   viewer.html?trace=<trace-url>&task=0x2a&start=<ns>&end=<ns>
   viewer.html?trace=<trace-url>&region=<a>-<b>&analysis=heap&heap-weight=count&inspector=stack
   viewer.html?trace=<trace-url>&poll=<poll-start>:<task-id>&inspector=poll&stack-view=flame&poll-section=sched&poll-worker-zoom=<f1>%09<f2>
   ```

   Selection anchors that depend on trace content are validated after load;
   an anchor absent from that trace is dropped without disturbing the rest of
   the link. The full parameter table above is the source of truth for agents.

### Enforcement

- `src/lib/url/url-contract.test.ts` (vitest) pins this section against the
  code: schema version, hash-key registry behavior (live keys round-trip,
  reserved keys preserved-not-honored), and the param tables against the
  recorded fixtures (`src/lib/url/legacy-params.fixture.ts`, `url_state.js`).
  Renaming this section's headings or table param names breaks that test by
  design.
- `live-checks/url-contract.mjs` (T12-style, live server) constructs the recipe
  URLs above and asserts the pages honor them end-to-end; see "Live UI
  checks" below.

## Live UI checks (`live-checks/`)

The UI's live regression tools are plain Node scripts, dev-only — `live-checks/`
is not a Vite input and never enters `dist/` or the crate package. Run them
against a live server (the dev-server, or `dial9 serve`; readiness gate:
`GET /api/config` returns JSON):

```bash
npm run build     # the dev-server serves ui/dist from disk
PORT=3021 cargo run -p dial9-viewer --bin dev-server --features dev-server
```

All tools run headless Chromium (playwright devDependency; run
`npx playwright install chromium` once) at a fixed 1440x900 viewport.
Tools that hit the browser page pin the page clock to the dev seed's date
(`lib/browser.mjs`) so the dated demo segment stays reachable through
relative time windows.

**Inventory row-walker** — drives every feature-inventory row's access path,
emits `VERIFIED` / `FAILED` / `NOT-TRIGGERABLE` per the shared verdict mapping
(chunk-1 tickets header). Green = zero FAILED; exit 0 only when green.
Amended rows (T15: features/01 G8/C6/I2/F4/F10) assert the canonical behavior
recorded by the inventory.

```bash
node live-checks/walk-rows.mjs \
  --inventory ../../docs/ui-inventory/features/01-index-html.md \
  --url http://localhost:3021/index.html \
  [--rows A1,F12] [--json live-checks/out/walk.json] [--md live-checks/out/walk.md]
```

**Fixture walk** (ticket T42) — the demo seed is a single segment on a
single host/boot, so some features/01 rows are recorded `NOT-TRIGGERABLE`
(boot transitions, seams, coverage gaps, the 200 MB cap, ...). The synthetic
fixture generator produces what the demo cannot, and `--fixtures` walks
exactly those rows against a fixture-seeded dev-server:

```bash
# 1. Generate (deterministic; ~4 s in release). Writes the committed small
#    fixtures under live-checks/fixtures/segments/ (a no-op diff unless the
#    generator changed) and the UNCOMMITTED seed tree under
#    live-checks/fixtures/generated/s3/ (~224 MB; --skip-large omits the
#    dial9-fixtures-large family and with it the H4 row).
cargo run --release -p dial9-viewer --features dev-server --bin gen-fixtures

# 2. Serve it (DIAL9_DEFAULT_PREFIX= empties the default prefix — the
#    D4/#471 date-root scenario needs discovery to see the date layer).
DIAL9_SEED_DIR=dial9-viewer/ui/live-checks/fixtures/generated/s3 \
  DIAL9_DEFAULT_PREFIX= PORT=3022 \
  cargo run -p dial9-viewer --features dev-server --bin dev-server

# 3. Walk. Default row set = the fixture-backed rows; the runner preflights
#    every fixture family the selected rows need and exits 2 with these
#    instructions when one is missing.
node live-checks/walk-rows.mjs \
  --inventory ../../docs/ui-inventory/features/01-index-html.md \
  --url http://localhost:3022/index.html --fixtures \
  [--json live-checks/out/fixture-walk.json]
```

Fixture-backed rows (registry: `live-checks/walkers/features01.fixtures.mjs`;
fixture geometry mirrors `src/bin/gen_fixtures.rs` — change them together):
C7, D4, F5, F7, F8, F9, F20, H4. H5's warning text renders only with
aggregation disabled, and any BYO-creds dev-server (which C7 needs) reports
aggregation enabled — it stays `NOT-TRIGGERABLE`. Recorded inventory verdicts
are NOT edited by the fixture walk; re-recording them is T39's final gate.

The seed tree is `<dir>/<bucket>/<key...>`; file **mtimes are load-bearing**
(they become S3 `last_modified`, the heatmap's segment end — the seam/gap
scenarios exist entirely in mtimes), which is why the tree is regenerated
rather than committed. Size policy: only the small fixtures under
`live-checks/fixtures/segments/` (tens of KB: the 10-segment boundary-poll set +
the multi-runtime #596 trace + `manifest.json`) are committed — the vitest
suites (`src/lib/trace/segments.fixtures.test.ts`, the real-parse anchor in
`segments.window.test.ts`) consume them hermetically. Everything under
`live-checks/fixtures/generated/` (incl. the >200 MB large family, which is also
T39's reproducible large-trace budget input) is gitignored and regenerable
byte-identically.

**Affordance census** — dump one page's interactive-control census, or
diff two pages' censuses (exit 0 only on ZERO diff):

```bash
node live-checks/census.mjs --url http://localhost:3021/index.html [--json p] [--md p]
node live-checks/census.mjs --a <pageUrlA> --b <pageUrlB> [--json p] [--md p]
```

**axe + contrast scan** — violation list (impact, rule, node count,
example target) in the shape 04-ux-findings cites, plus a contrast summary
line. Report producer (exit 0); `--fail-on <impact>` turns it into a gate:

```bash
node live-checks/axe-scan.mjs --url <pageUrl> [--json p] [--md p] [--fail-on serious]
```

**URL-contract check** - the live half of the URL contract's
enforcement (the codec-level pin is `src/lib/url/url-contract.test.ts`):
constructs the contract section's deep-link recipe URLs in plain Node (no
browser) and asserts real pages honor them: the viewer opens with an exact
parse range and viewport, both zoom-link forms restore, reserved hash keys
are inert, and a foreign version restores nothing. Exit 0 only when all legs
pass:

```bash
node live-checks/url-contract.mjs --base http://localhost:3021 [--json p]
```

Self-tests (run whenever the tools themselves change): a census diff against
the same URL must emit ZERO diff; the row-walker against the canonical browser
page must stay green (zero FAILED).

## Tests — IMPORTANT for agents

Vitest is the single JavaScript test runner (ADR-0004 section 7):

- **Vitest suites** (`tests/core/**/*.test.{js,ts}` for shared core,
  `src/**/*.test.ts` for TypeScript modules) run with `npm run test` and
  are auto-discovered — no registration needed. The `ui` job in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs them against the committed demo trace.
- **Trace-dependent suites** additionally run against a freshly regenerated
  demo trace: the `trace-integrity` CI job runs
  `../../scripts/e2e-trace-tests.sh`, which regenerates
  `public/demo-trace.bin` (needs DynamoDB Local) and then runs a filtered
  `vitest run` over its `TRACE_SUITES` list. If a new suite's assertions must
  hold against regenerated traces (not just the committed one), add it to
  that list.
- **Env-var overrides** (formerly argv): `D9_TRACE_FILE` points
  `trace_integrity.test.ts` at another trace file, `DIAL9_TRACE_PATH` does
  the same for `time_range.test.ts`, `D9_SCALE_LARGE=1` runs
  `directory_scale.test.ts` with 200 files, and `D9_DIAGNOSTIC_TRACES`
  points `diagnose_setup.test.ts` at generated diagnostic traces (suite
  skips when the directory is absent; run
  `scripts/generate_diagnostic_traces.sh` first).
- **Exception:** `test_parser.js` stays a plain Node script at the ui/ root —
  the Rust integration test `dial9-tokio-telemetry/tests/js_parser.rs`
  invokes it by filename as `node test_parser.js <trace.bin>
  <expected.jsonl>`. Do not move or rename it without updating that test.
- `bench_parse.js` is a benchmark, not a test.
